## FLEXIBLE CONVERSION TRACKING

The function automatically detects your account's conversion events in this order:

1. **Purchase** - Standard e-commerce purchase
2. **Offsite Conversion (Purchase)** - Pixel-based purchase tracking
3. **Offsite Conversion (Generic)** - Any offsite conversion
4. **Onsite Conversion** - On-platform conversions

Cost per purchase follows the same logic - it will match whatever conversion event is being tracked.

---

## EXPORT TO CSV/EXCEL

After running the report, you can ask:

```
Format this data as a CSV table
```

or

```
Show me this in a table format that I can copy to Excel
```

---

## TIPS

1. **Start with higher min_spend** - Use `min_spend=50` or `min_spend=100` to reduce data volume
2. **Use shorter date ranges** - `last_7d` instead of `last_30d` for faster results
3. **Filter by campaign** - Analyze one campaign at a time for detailed insights
4. **Batch exports** - Request small batches (limit=25) if context window is an issue
